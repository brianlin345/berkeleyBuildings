# berkeleyBuildings
This program calculates the optimal path, with the shortest total distance, between a series of buildings on the Berkeley campus. 
A connected graph is constructed from buildings inputted by the user, with edge weights given by a distance matrix generated by geocodingBuildings.py.
The optimal path between all the buildings is calculated by solving a Traveling Salesman Problem using Dynamic Programming.
___
## Information/Setup
The interface for this program is implemented using console output inside the terminal, with output generated from passing a valid command format into the Main class.
To get the distance matrix between all the buildings, run the geocodingBuildings.py script and move the resulting .csv file into the same directory as the Java files.
___
## Commands:
add [name]: adds a new set of buildings to calculate optimal path for.
update [name]: changes contents of an existing set of buildings to calculate optimal path for.
remove [name]: removes an existing set of buildings.
list: displays all existing sets of buildings to calculate optimal path for.
help: displays a help message listing command syntax and the list of included buildings.
